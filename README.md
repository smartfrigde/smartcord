### Suggestions? Comments?

Feel free to chat in our [support server](https://discord.gg/F25bc4RYDt). We have a #suggestions channel as well as many others to discuss SmartCord and other topics.

### Contributing

Feel free to make pull requests or make your own plugins repository. If you do make your own plugins, request the 'Plugin Developer' role in the support server so you can announce your releases!

### Security or lack of it
Modding your Discord client is not secure. It tweaks Discord security so **unofficial** plugins and themes can load. If you take security very seriously then don't use **any** mod client. But if you don't install unknown plugins nothing bad will happen *probably*. When using plugins that are included with SmartCord there's really small chance of you getting any harm. Stay safe and don't download plugins from shady sources.

### Credits

Big shotout to EnhancedDiscord developers and plugin makers. This project is just "personalized" fork of EnhancedDiscord that wants to continue it's development in it's own way. I'm not professional coder and I suck lol. Don't expect high tier coding or good coding at all. I used few scripts/snippets shared on EnhancedDiscord server huge thanks to developers of those. I also used parts of GooseMod code for it's support and ported plugins.
